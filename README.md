# Intrusion-Detection-System
The Intrusion detection system will have successfully provided a robust mechanism  for real-time identification and prevention of Intrusion attacks within a Windows  environment. The Python script will efficiently scan and analyze the packets  received and detects attacks before they can cause significant harm. The integration  with a centralized web monitoring UI will allow administrators to manage multiple  machines, monitor potential threats, and Machine learning model to predict the intensity of DOS Attack. Technologies Used: React, Node.js, MongoDB, Express, Python, Virtualbox(Windows, Kali linux) Key achievements  include the automation of threat detection, enhanced network security, seamless  communication between the detection script and the web UI, and a user-friendly  interface for managing machine statuses. This project will ultimately contribute to a  safer and more secure network environment.
